Basic testing of data from TRN database using PyTest framework.

The chosen merging strategy is GitHub Flow. The repository holds 2 types of branches: main and features. As per the project requirements, the release frequency is periodic and service preferences is open source. The number of the team is not large so having every approved PR deployed to production first won't be a huge blocker.
